              <h2>Here's a time line of Walt Disney:</h2>


              <ul>
                <li>1901 - Disney was born on December 5 in Chicago, Illinois. </li> <br>
                <li>1911 - His family moved to Kansas City, where Disney developed a love for trains.</li> <br>
                <li>1917 - He dropped out of school to join the Army but was rejected for being underage. He was 16 years old</li><br>
                <li>1919 - Disney moved to Kansas City to pursue a career as a newspaper artist. His brother Roy got him a job at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio, where he met cartoonist Ubbe Eert Iwwerks. Disney worked at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he made commercials based on cutout animation.</li><br>
                <li>1922 - Disney and Iwerks started a small studio of their own and acquired a secondhand movie camera with which they made one and two-minute animated advertising films for distribution to local movie theatres. They also did a series of animated cartoon sketches and the pilot film for a series of seven-minute fairy tales that combined both live action and animation, Alice in Cartoonland.</li><br>
                <li>1923 - A New York film distributor cheated the young producers, and Disney was forced to file for bankruptcy. He moved to California to pursue a career as a cinematographer, but the surprise success of the first Alice film compelled Disney and his brother Roy—a lifelong business partner—to reopen shop in Hollywood. With Roy as business manager, Disney resumed the Alice series, persuading Iwerks to join him and assist with the drawing of the cartoons.</li><br>
                <li>1927 - Disney and Iwerks experimented with a new character—a cheerful, energetic, and mischievous mouse called Mickey.</li><br>

                <li>1934 - He began work on a version of the classic fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White (1937) was widely acclaimed by critics and audiences alike as an amusing and sentimental romance. </li><br>
